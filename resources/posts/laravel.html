    Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP
    and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like
    Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel
    applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of
    requests per month.
