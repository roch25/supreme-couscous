    Svelte is a component framework — like React or Vue — but with an important difference. Traditional frameworks allow you to write declarative state-driven code, but there's a penalty: the browser must do extra work to convert those declarative structures into DOM operations, using techniques like  that eat into your frame budget and tax the garbage collector.

<p>
    Instead, Svelte runs at build time, converting your components into highly efficient imperative code that surgically updates the DOM. As a result, you're able to write ambitious applications with excellent performance characteristics.

    The first version of Svelte was all about testing a hypothesis — that a purpose-built compiler could generate rock-solid code that delivered a great user experience. The second was a small upgrade that tidied things up a bit.
